Repository Name: Node.js Notes App

# Description:
The Node.js Notes App is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, providing a RESTful API for managing notes.

# Features:

Create Notes: Users can create new notes by sending a POST request to the API endpoint. Each note consists of a title and content.

Read Notes: Users can retrieve a list of all notes by sending a GET request to the API endpoint. Individual notes can be accessed by their unique identifier.

Update Notes: Users can update existing notes by sending a PUT request to the API endpoint, providing the note's unique identifier and the updated title/content.

Delete Notes: Users can delete notes by sending a DELETE request to the API endpoint, specifying the note's unique identifier.

# Technologies Used:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code on the server.
Express: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores the notes data.
RESTful API: The app follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) to provide a standardized way of interacting with the server.
